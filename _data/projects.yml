      <br>&emsp;&emsp;I lead a team of engineers in developing the software for a fully autonomous vision-based drone. Our core tech stack included:
      <ul type="square">
        <li> PID controls for attitude stabilization and trajectory tracking </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono" target="_blank"> VINS-Mono</a> for VIO </li>
        <li> Structure from motion </li>
        <li> On-line trajectory generation </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN" target="_blank"> Mask R-CNN</a> for object detection</li>
